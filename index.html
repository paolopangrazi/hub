			<p><b>I read a lot</b>. Really, a lot.<br><br>
			   I am an avid reader of anything that sparks my interest.<br> 
			   I usually read in the original language of the author, I believe that translation is a really hard job.<br>
			   Nuances sometimes got unfortunately lost in the translation process, hence it is always a good idea to get the book in the original langauge.<br><br>
			   I try to extend constantly my perspective and mindset reading about different topics and area:<br>
			   - Psychology: every book of <u><a href="https://powerseductionandwar.com/" target="_blank">Robert Greene</a></u> is a masterpiece.<br>
			   - Design (product design, typography, UI/UX) - Recommendation: all books of <u><a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/" target="_blank">Edward Tufte</a></u>.<br> 
			   - Computer science - well, the list here is too long, maybe I will create an extra section for it.<br>
			   - Historical books - Ken Follett, how teach history from middle age down to modern history.<br>
		       - Trading and market analysis - Elliot Wave Principle (Frost, Prechter)
			<p>These are at the moment my favourite 3 books:<br></p>
